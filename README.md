# Github-notes


Git is essentially the version control software which can track everything that has been done while working on a computer but another key idea is the use of advanced and sophisticated features when you are collaborating with other people meaning it can handle more than 2 people working on the same thing at the same time.


Github is known as a web service and developer platform where you can share, edit, manage and create code all in one website using git software as its basic function and structure so people can create anything even if it isn't related to technology.


Repo is basically a digital storage for files where people can personally add and create changes to source code on their desired application like a website.


Commit is like your save button but you are able to include notes so when Git tracks the history people working with you on your project can see that this person made these changes leading to further development and collaboration.
